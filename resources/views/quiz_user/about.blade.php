  <p id="about">
    NoBrainer began as the brainchild of 5 computer scientists studying at the University of Portsmouth. It was designed as an alternative to other quiz apps out there that were too slow to load and felt clunky. The app continues today to allow people to quiz others and enhance people's learning experience
